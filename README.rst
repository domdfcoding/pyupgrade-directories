Installation
--------------

.. start installation

``pyupgrade-directories`` can be installed from PyPI.

To install with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python -m pip install pyupgrade-directories

.. end installation


Usage
--------------

``pyupgrade-directories`` is called from the command line with ``pyup_dirs``.

Basic usage is the same as ``pyupgrade``.
See https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/blob/master/README.md for more information.

The key difference is that passing a directory to ``pyup_dir`` will process all ``.py`` files in the directory.
There is also ``--recursive`` flag that will recurse subdirectories.

Any ``.pyd``, ``.pyc`` and ``.pyo`` files are excluded, along with any files in
``__pycache__``, ``.tox``, ``.mypy_cache``, ``.pytest_cache`` and ``venv`` directories.
